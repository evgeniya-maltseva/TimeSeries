# TimeSeries
Example jupyter notebooks for dealing with time series.
Project 1 - **Energy consumption forecast**    
This is the small part of the framework. Scripts are not going to run as not every file is uploaded and input data is absent. They are here just as sample code.
    
Project 2 - **ASHRAE**.   
In the notebooks are varios models of metered building energy usage in the following areas: chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters. 
The data comes from over 1,000 buildings over a three-year timeframe. With better estimates of these energy-saving investments, large scale investors 
and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies.
